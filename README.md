# ESP8266_WifiManualWebServer_0
ESP8266 wifi server that controls the onboard LED. Edited to display the correct state of the LED, but the intermediate variable is still incorrect. I will fix this in another version.

Edit 5/27/2022:
There is no need to edit this program. The D1 microcontroller's onboard LED is active low. The original program is best for controlling peripherals and this one is best for controlling the onboard LED.
